# Global_Warming
An analysis investigating the statistical significance of global warming using historical temperature data.

A simple regression analysis found that temperatures for the past 10 years greatly exceeded their expected levels in relation to the historical data but concerns about data collection and the merging of two disparate sources of information ultimately made the findings essentially inconclusive.

The attached Jupyter Notebook contains all code used and annotations of process.
